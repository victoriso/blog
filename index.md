**Day 1**

Hey everyone! I decided to write this blog as it said in the book. But i'll begin by explaining myself. I won't be giving away my real name, but I have 2 online nicknames. I go by Artu and Artufacts. I have 1 year of experience, but I don't know much. I understand the basics of infosec and cybersec but I want to learn more. Hopefully this book teaches me a lot about infosec. So yeah! I'll be writing a lot and read a lot and hopefully look back on this in the future. Anyways, I'm gonna start reading!
